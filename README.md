# BusKaro

`Why wait for bus when you can BusKaro`

![Workflow](./assets/images/workflow.png?raw=true "Workflow")

- The main goal of our project is to provide local bus services to passengers, so that they can travel with ease.
- We built an app which tracks the location, route, timing and seat occupancy of a local bus so as to reduce waiting time on bus stops.
- It has features like 'shake' which dials emergency call lines when the device is shaken in case of any theft, assault etc.
- We'll also be providing online payment option to avoid change problem in the bus.
